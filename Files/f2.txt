When I get older I want to be a teacher. It has to be the coolest job in the world. The trouble is that I want to teach every subject. There are so many things to teach about and I don't think schools will let teachers teach about everything.

So far my list of things I want to teach about include: Jupiter and planets, writing fairy tales, growing potatoes and tomatoes, playing tennis, boat safety, and working in a hospital. Last week our class learned about alligators - this made me want to teach about animals. Then this week, I have learned about tools and building and that makes me want to teach about construction.

My mom also asked me if I would like to learn to play the guitar a few days ago.

"Of course I do. I want to learn everything so I can teach anything," I said. I tell my parents about how cool teaching is all the time. They won't tell me, but I think they get tired hearing about all of the different things I want to teach about.

They tell me I should definitely become a teacher if I love it so much. My plan is to teach high school classes in six different subject areas. I am starting to prepare now by learning as much as I can. I read a ton. I do a lot of interviewing too. Asking people what they do has taught me so much about things I can teach.
